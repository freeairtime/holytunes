Verse 1:            If your Faith ... can be as small as a mustard seed
                         You can move mountains,you can break walls
                         If your Faith... can be as small as a mustard seed 
                         You can fly higher than ever before 
                                    
                         (You need Faith)
                            
Chorus:             You need Faith to be victorious (You need Faith)
                         You need Faith to win the battle (You need Faith)
                         (Oh) Without Faith all your prayers goes astray                 x2
                         For your Prayers to be heard
                         The only thing you need is Faith (You need Faith)

Verse 2:            If not Faith Hannah won`t have bore a child
                         Cause of lack of Faith the Disciples couldn`t calm the storm
                         If not Faith i will not be standing here
                         You will not be standing here
                         So we have to increase Faith 
                            
                         (You need Faith)    
                            
                         Chorus
