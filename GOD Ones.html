Chorus:             He who touch these little ones
                         That Loves me with all their heart
                         It will be better for them
                         To go to the ocean and drown
                         I`m one of GOD`s little ones
                         I Love him with all my Heart
                         So why will the devil ever harm me in his hands

                         (Oh)

Verse 1:            The devil cannot touch me 
                         Even satan cannot touch me
                         No demonic agent on Earth
                         Or under Earth can touch me
                         I`m one of Jesus children 
                         And he really really Loves me 
                         He loves you too if you just give your Life to him wholly
                         
                         Chorus
