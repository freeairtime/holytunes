Verse 1:            I know a GOD that made a Shepherd to be King
                         I know a GOD that helped a weaklin battle and win
                         I know a GOD that changed my Life just so i`ll be free
                         Jesus you`re the only GOD i`ll serve

Chorus:             So i will never disobey your word 
                         I`ll never stop talking to you 
                         I`ll never leave you for any one or anything
                         I`ll never let the devil win
                         I`ll always bring people to you 
                         I`ll read the Bible Pray everyday and even 
                         Though the Heaven pass i`ll be with you my GOD
                         Jesus you`re the only God i`ll serve
                         
Verse 2:            He is the GOD that made David to be King
                         He is the GOD that helped Gideon battle and win
                         He is the GOD that took his Life just so we`ll be free
                         Jesus you`re the only GOD i`ll serve       
                         
                         Chorus
